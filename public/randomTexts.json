      "Though in it's own way this is a useful page, its here as a part of me online for all to see, oh how vulnerable but there ain't nothing as secure as openess how can you break into something that was never there?",
      "Enough pointless musings that obviously have no other metaphorical implications, I'm here to wrench and drag out the ideas encrusted into the universe, spoken by people and then put them in a computer so other people, and sometimes even me, never have to think about them ever again.",
      "The thing I'm most serious about is having fun (I love irony, though under most definitions of fun this isn't even ironic (this is a long brackets))",
      "Things in an of themselves are rarely the issue, the issue is generally everything else",

      "Futueres aren't given, they're made and molded",
      "I'm always impressed by rainbows, they're just an illusion though and it's not talked about enough, there is no rainbow from some prism, it's emergent from all the little raindrops and their perticular angle to you, so in a way as well everyone gets their own rainbow because they're all looking at something a bit different. So amazing!",
