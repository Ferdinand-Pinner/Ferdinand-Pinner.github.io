            guy making his way through life with a healthy helping of computers,

            though in it&apos;s own way this is a useful page, its here as a
            part of me online for all to see, oh how vulnerable but there
            ain&apos;t nothing as secure as openess how can you break into
            something that was never there?

            enough pointless musings that obviously have no other metaphorical
            implications, I&apos;m here to wrench and drag out the ideas
            encrusted into the universe, spoken by people and then put them in a
            computer so other people, and sometimes even me, never have to think
            about them ever again.

            The thing I&apos;m most serious about is having fun (I love irony)
            while doing a little engineering, there&apos;s no point doing
            anything if you don&apos;t enjoy it, and if you don&apos;t enjoy
            either make doing it fun or find something else to do, luckily I
            find myself tending to like doing it, but as everyone knows
            throughout all the moments in their life it&apos;s never the it
            that&apos;s the problem it&apos;s the everything else
