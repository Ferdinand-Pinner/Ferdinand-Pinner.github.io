      Hi! welcome to my little website, it&apos;s meant to be a little view into
      my mind, a little manifestion of my mind if you will, I&apos;m an
      engineer, a lover of the arts most things expressionist are my jam and I
      love prog rock and math rock and I love philosophy. Always found it hard
      to write about myself and say something at the same time, it&apos;s like
      describing a box when you&apos;re inside it. So it&apos;s easier to talk
      about what&apos;s going on and what&apos;s happening in the moment, but in
      the moment you lose the box. That&apos;s kinda where I am in the moment,
      in the box and forgetting I&apos;m there
    </div>
